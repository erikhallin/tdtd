Not the Pixels!

In the near future, pixels left their screens and went rogue. The current situation is dangerous and we have to defend ourselves. 
In this Top-Down Shooter, Tower Defence, Clicker with some rythm elements (towers try to keep a rythm) you have to defend your base using your ship to intercept the threat. Build defences and wall off the incoming horde. Also, you have to gather supplies and prepare the equipment by intense clicking.
You will face different opponents using various tactics. Learn their weaknesses and prepare for more.

Controls:
While in air (Pick up supply boxes by colliding with them. Deliver them by landing in the base)
A/D - Rotate your ship
W/S - Increase/decrease your speed
Space - Fire
Left mouse button - Build a tower
Right mouse button - Build a wall
While landed (Land by approaching the landing strip in a straight angle. Lift by pressing any button)
Left mouse button - Click to convert supplies (orange bar) to the material used to build towers and walls (yellow bar)

Extra:
Shift - Activate aim
Ctrl - Hold down to rotate the ship slower

Good to know:
The pixels will eventually break walls
Towers will only work against small pixels. Larger pixels require ship bullets to be removed
Landing could be tricky, practice, you have to land straight
